<h1 align="center">Android SQLite CRUD</h1>

In this project, I developed a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using SQLite in Android Studio. The purpose of this project was to provide users with an introduction to SQLite technology.

# üìÅ Access to the project

**You can access the source code(On branch sqlite_basic_crud) of the initial project or download it.**

# :bug: Possible errors:

Please note that in this project, I utilize the 'font' feature introduced in Android 8.0 (API level 26), which allows the use of fonts as resources using XML. However, this feature is only supported on devices with this specification. If you encounter any issues while running the project and want to avoid this problem, you can remove the following line from the code:

`theme.xml
<item name="fontFamily">@font/poppins</item>`
